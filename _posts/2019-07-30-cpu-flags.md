如果需要用到半虚拟化技术肯定就需要查看cpu是否支持了。查看方式就是cat /proc/cpuinfo 查看flags是否有vmx和svm。那这些flags都表示什么呢？

## 86
32位又名i386-i686和64位又名amd64。这些cpu基本就是你的工作站，笔记本电脑或服务器。

64位（x86_64/AMD64/Intel64）？ lm
硬件虚拟化（VMX/AMD-V）？vmx（英特尔），svm（AMD）
加速AES（AES-NI）？ aes
TXT（TPM）？ smx
管理程序（如此宣布）？ hypervisor


## 所有的flags
完整的flags列表位于文件的内核源代码中 arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h。

P.S. This listing was derived from arch/x86/include/asm/cpufeatures.h in the kernel source. The flags are listed in the same order as the source code. Please help by adding links to descriptions of features when they're missing, by writing a short description of features that have an unexpressive names, and by updating the list for new kernel versions. The current list is from Linux 4.15 plus some later additions.
